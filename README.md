# Mess

Messenger statistics.

## Setup 

1. Download your messenger chat history. You can follow  [this](https://www.zapptales.com/en/download-facebook-messenger-chat-history-how-to/). I suggest you download only last year or so, otherwise it takes ages to complete your file creation.
2. Move `inbox` folder from extracted zip archive to `<this-repo>/res` (`res` folder is ignored in this repo not to exhibit your personal data)
3. 
```elixir
# Install dependencies
mix deps.get
```

4. Check if it's compiling: `mix test`
